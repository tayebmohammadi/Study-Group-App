# Dali Study Groups App

This project is part of the Dali initiative, aiming to create a platform exclusively for college students to form and join study groups. The first phase focuses on the "Study" app, with future plans for a Reddit-like community.

## Project Vision

The Study app enables college students to:
- Create and join study groups centered around any topic (e.g., "What is the meaning of life?").
- Collaborate, chat, and organize both virtual and physical study sessions.

## Key Features

1. **Group Creation**
   - Any student can create a group with a description and set specific rules.
   - Admins can define group capacity (maximum number of members).
   - Option to set recurring sessions (e.g., weekly study meetings).
   - Specify the agenda or purpose of the group (potential for AI assistance in agenda creation).
   - Choose between "quiet study" or "loud/collaborative" modes.

2. **Session Management**
   - Track lateness: define how many minutes late is acceptable.
   - Set guidelines for what is appropriate to share within the group.
   - Book physical rooms (if available) or set up Zoom/virtual meetings.

3. **Group Interaction**
   - In-group chat for real-time communication during sessions.
   - Chat history is saved for future reference.
   - Members can provide feedback on each other's participation and adherence to group rules.

4. **Inclusivity**
   - Groups can be about any topic, academic or philosophical, as long as they foster learning and discussion.

## Future Plans

- Expand to a Reddit-like community for college students.
- Integrate more AI features for agenda setting and group moderation.
